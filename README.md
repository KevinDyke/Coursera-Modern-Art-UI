# Coursera Modern Art UI

This repository contains the source code for my submission for the Coursera course "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming).

The project involves an user interface based on modern art. The screen displays nine randomly coloured squares and a slider. As the slider is moved the colours change returning to the original colour when the slider is in the left hand position.

Clicking on the the action bar displays a more information button. This button display a dialogue with two options. The first is to visit the New York Museum of Modern Art's website (www.moma.org). The seconds just cancels the dialogue.
